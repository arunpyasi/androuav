Android phones are a cheap, powerful and light way to include GPS, compass, video, photos and connectivity to hobby UAVs.

AndroUAV includes:
  * Android application for sensor data acquisition
  * Arduino code for flight control based on AeroQuad.
  * Auxiliar electronics and electrical connections

What it will be capable of:
  * GPS Navigation
  * Real-time telemetry
  * Real-time video over the Internet/Wi-Fi
  * Obstacle avoidance

AndroUAV is an interface between receiver and control board and should be fully compatible with a wide range of platforms. A great opensource example is [AeroQuad](http://code.google.com/p/aeroquad).
